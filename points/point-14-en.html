        <h2>Historical context</h2>
        <p>
          The Baroni College, located at 123 Via Pignolo and today home to the
          University of Bergamo, was founded at the end of the nineteenth century
          as an elementary school with an attached boarding school, commissioned
          by Professor Angelo Baroni. It later became a boarding school of the
          Royal Technical Industrial Institute, hosting students from across the
          province.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the German occupation, on 3 October 1943, the building was
          requisitioned and transformed into the headquarters of the German
          Gendarmerie Command and into a political prison.

        <h2>Why it is a place of memory</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1943 and 1945, the Baroni College was one of the main sites of
          Nazi repression in Bergamo. Anti-fascists and partisans accused of crimes
          against German authority were imprisoned and interrogated here, before
          being transferred to the Sant’Agata prison or to the monastery of
          Matris Domini.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous testimonies recount extremely harsh interrogations and inhuman
          torture. Don Mario Benigni suffered violence for days, while other
          prisoners were brutally killed. This building stands as a symbol of the
          violence of the Nazi occupation and of the sacrifice of those who fought
          for freedom.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          «In this boarding school violently occupied between 1943 and 1945, the
          Nazi police raged against our finest brothers: freedom took root thanks
          to their sacrifice».

        <h2>In-depth study: transfer of prisoners and testimonies</h2>

        <p>
          According to several testimonies, in <strong>January 1944</strong> the
          SS guarding the Baroni College were recalled to the front and the
          building was emptied of prisoners during the night of the 21st.
          At least five witnesses – <em>Franco Maj, Cesare Bonino, Giovan Battista
          Cortinovis, Luigi Mondini, Giacomo Paganoni</em> – recount that night.
        </p>

        <p>
          The prisoners, according to Cesare Bonino a total of <strong>56</strong>
          under the custody of about ten SS soldiers, were brought out into the
          courtyard under the watchful eyes of their worried guards, as noted by
          Cortinovis, and transferred to the <strong>Sant’Agata</strong> prison,
          where a German garrison had been installed since December 1943.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was not a definitive closure of the Baroni: even in
          <strong>March 1944</strong>, captured partisans were brought there,
          such as <em>Adriana Locatelli</em> and some of her companions from the
          Maresana group. It is likely that the very limited German staff was
          supported by fascist personnel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The comparison of testimonies reveals an increasingly efficient
          organization of the fascist repressive apparatus, in which figures
          such as <strong>Resmini, Strohmenger, Monge, Ghisleni, Zanchi,
          Messaggi</strong> emerge, working in complete synergy with the Nazi one.
