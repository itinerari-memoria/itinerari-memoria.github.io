        <h2>Historical context</h2>

        <p>
          At Torquato Tasso Street 18, where the “Giacomo e Pio Manzù” State Art High School is currently 
          located, there once stood a building that housed the offices of
          <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup1">the Special Tribunal</span>
          for the Defense of the State.

              <strong>Institution:</strong>
              Created in 1926 by the fascist regime after the so-called “fascist laws,” it became operational in 1927 to target political
              opponents and suppress democratic freedoms. It was abolished in 1943 and later re-established by the Italian Social 
              Republic until the Liberation.<br>
              <strong>Function:</strong>
              It judged so-called “political crimes,” including anti-fascist activities, the dissemination of underground press,
              membership in banned parties, and offenses against the regime. The defense of the State was synonymous with the 
              defense of fascism.<br>
              <strong>Composition and trials:</strong>
              It was largely composed of military personnel and regime members. Trials were swift, with few guarantees for 
              defendants and severe limitations on defense and appeal. Verdicts were often predetermined.<br>
              <strong>Punishments:</strong>
              It imposed prison sentences, internal exile, forced labor, and in some cases the death penalty. 
              The consequences often extended to the social and professional lives of the accused.<br>
              <strong>Historical significance:</strong>
              The Special Tribunal turned justice into a tool of political repression. Today it is remembered as a symbol 
              of the denial of the rule of law and a warning about the dangers of dictatorships.

          The Special Tribunal was established by the fascist regime on November 25, 1926, and became operational in 1927. 
          After an initial suppression in July 1943, it was re-established by the Italian Social Republic and remained 
          active until the Liberation, with a branch also operating in Bergamo.

        <h2>The stabilization of the 1930s</h2>

        <p>
          In the 1930s, the Special Tribunal of Bergamo played a central role in the stabilization of fascist justice, 
          particularly thanks to
          <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup2">the 1931 Extension Law</span>.
        </p>

              Its powers expanded: the tribunal was no longer limited to repressing anti-fascism, but became more broadly involved 
              in defending the personality of the State and the security of the regime.
            </p>

        <p>
          Although it represented the judicial apex of political repression, the tribunal did not hold a monopoly in this field, 
          but operated within a multi-centered system alongside the Ministry of the Interior, the police, the Carabinieri, and the 
          Fascist Party, with frequent overlaps of authority. Within this system, the Special Tribunal of Bergamo played a selective 
          role: it mainly judged the most serious and symbolically significant political crimes, while everyday surveillance and 
          preventive control remained the responsibility of other bodies. In this way, it helped make political repression a stable 
          and ordinary element of the fascist legal system, strengthening the consolidation of the regime.

        <h2>Why it is a place of memory</h2>

        <p>
          The Special Tribunal represents one of the most repressive instruments of the fascist dictatorship. Created after the 
          introduction of the “fascist laws,” it was used to strike down any form of political opposition, eliminating fundamental 
          freedoms such as freedom of the press, association, and the right to strike.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trials were swift and devoid of guarantees: defendants often did not know the charges against them, had no right to appeal, 
          and could even be sentenced to death. Verdicts were frequently predetermined, turning the tribunal into a powerful tool 
          of fear and control.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          The Special Tribunal reveals the true face of dictatorship: a state that used the law not to guarantee justice, but to suppress dissent.

        <h2>Further insight: after the Liberation</h2>

        <p>
          After the fall of fascism and the end of World War II, places like this lost their repressive function. In the climate of 
          democratic reconstruction of the Italian Republic, the building was repurposed for educational use, becoming the home of 
          the Art High School founded in the early 1960s. Transforming a place associated with control and repression into a school 
          reflected the desire to return these spaces to the community and to affirm new values based on education, culture, and freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          The subsequent naming of the school after Giacomo and Pio Manzù reinforces the symbolic meaning of this transformation: 
          from the headquarters of a tribunal that suppressed free thought to a place devoted to creativity and artistic expression. 
          Today, studying in this building means inhabiting a space that tells the story of Italy’s transition from dictatorship to 
          democracy, turning a place of repression into one of education and freedom.
