        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
            We are in front of the Montelungo Barracks in Bergamo, a military garrison that during the Italian Social Republic (1943-1945) became one of the operational centers of the Republican National Guard (GNR) and, as sources testify, one of the places of imprisonment and interrogation for captured anti-fascists, partisans, and opponents. In a city where popular support for the Resistance could be "tacit complicity, often of open favor," places like this barracks represented the repressive apparatus of the Fascist Salò state. Those arrested for subversive activities were brought here, such as participation in the general strikes of March 1944 – a massive workers' mobilization that marked the resurgence of popular protagonism – before being transferred to prisons like Sant'Agata or, often, sent towards deportation to Nazi concentration camps.

        <h2>Why it is a Place of Memory</h2>
        <p>
            The Montelungo Barracks is a fundamental place of memory because it materializes the mechanism of political repression and the passage from civil struggle to the tragedy of deportation. Symbolically, it connects the collective choices of resistance – like the strikes, experienced sometimes with "blessed unawareness" – to the machinery of arrest, interrogation, and subsequent deportation to the camps. Remembering this place means recognizing that the deprivation of liberty and institutional violence often started from ordinary buildings in the heart of cities. Today, in an era where democratic rights cannot be taken for granted, this site compels us to remember the price of freedom and the courage of those who, even in the face of the brutality of prison and the threat of deportation, maintained their dignity and rejection of dictatorship.

        <div class="note">
            "Capture is marked first and foremost by surprise... it almost seems like an inevitable fate." – This reflection, taken from the testimonies of deportees, captures the trauma of sudden arrest and the unheard-of violation of normality that began in places like this.
